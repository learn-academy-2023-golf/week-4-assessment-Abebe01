# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: A virtual DOM is either the displayed local window page (3000) or something to do with the UI where the person inputs info and interacts with the app/site.

Researched answer: A Javascript object that essentially act as a mirror, or branch of the real DOM. In the same way a branch is used during the GIT/GIT HUB cycle to work on instead of altering the main until approved/merged. The virtual DOM does the same. 

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: A shortcut(s) ?

Researched answer: It means Ruby will automatically return the result of the last executed statement within the method. You don't need to use the return keyword explicitly to return a value.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: 
Javasrpit and Ruby both have: Coding languages// Share some syntax // contain conditionals, objects, & classes
Javasrpit and Ruby differ in: Casing conventions// implicit returns// terminal executuin and commands

Researched answer:
Javasrpit and Ruby both have: Dynamic Typing - this means that you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly, and the type of a variable can change during runtime // Object-Oriented - They use objects and classes for structuring and organizing code. // Garbage Collection - Both have automatic memmory storage/deletion.
Javasrpit and Ruby differ in: Casing convention // Syntax and Style// Ecosystem and Libraries.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A program that manages/ determines the version of software you're running on a given program?

Researched answer: a software tool or system that allows you to manage and switch between multiple versions of software, programming languages, or libraries. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: An anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome, usually defined with do and end. 

2. RSpec: A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for Ruby, usually used for testing. 

3. Test-driven development: TDD a method used to write test before writing the actual code using "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle.
